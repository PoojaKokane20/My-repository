    "Welcome to this two-part demonstration on using transformer models for the **Sentence-pair Classification Case Study!** In this case study, we shall use pre-trained transformer models to build an ML solution for *Quoflow*, a question-answering website similar to Quora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is **sentence-pair classification** important?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ability to determine the similarity between pairs of sentences is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP). Applications include question answering, paraphrase detection, and textual entailment, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "We will focus on the task of sentence-pair classification, where the goal is to predict whether two sentences are semantically equivalent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task, we will be using the powerful **Huggingface** library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained transformer models and NLP pipelines for various NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will scaffold our learning in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part 1** : *Introduction to Huggingface*\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the first part of this tutorial, we will explore the different features and functionalities of the Huggingface library. You will learn how to use Huggingface pipelines to perform various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text generation, and named entity recognition. You will also learn how to load a pre-trained transformer model  to perform any NLP task. By the end of this part, you will be able to customize Huggingface pipelines to process any input sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part 2**: *Fine-tuning BERT for Sentence-Pair Classification*\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the second part of this tutorial, we will dive deeper into the sentence-pair classification task and show you how to fine-tune BERT-based models using Huggingface. We will use the Quora Question Pair (QQP) dataset, which is part of the GLUE benchmark, as our training and evaluation data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of both notebooks, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with the Huggingface library, how to fine-tune BERT-based models for sentence-pair classification, and how to evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics. You will also have the knowledge and skills to customize the models and pipelines for your own NLP tasks."

    "## Introduction to Huggingface\n",
    "\n",
    "[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) is one of the most popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) by providing a platform through which anyone can access the latest models in each of the domain like Computer vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's one of the most popular platform?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Huggingface, research in NLP was conducted in silos, and it was difficult for the community to access any of the latest models from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Therefore, Huggingface has **democratized the research by giving users direct access to state-of-the-art models**. With its simple and intuitive API, Huggingface has made it easier than ever for researchers and developers to incorporate NLP models into their applications.\n",
    "Using its platform, you can easily download any model, fine-tune it, and create models for your custom task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's this notebook about?\n",
    "One of the most disruptive and innovative architecture in NLP is Transformer. a type of neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. Huggingface provides pre-trained transformer models that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, as well as tools for training custom transformer models from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites to understand this notebook** :\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook revolves around utilising different transformer models and applying them to solve different NLP tasks, therefore we expect you to go through the theory of Transformer architecture covered in the previous session.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**:\n",
    "> In this notebook: \n",
    "1. You will explore the different features and functionalities of the Huggingface library.\n",
    "2. You will look into the different pipelines and demonstrate how to use them for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.\n",
    "3. You will learn how to load a pre-trained transformer model to perform any NLP task.\n",
    "4. You will dissect the pipeline feature of Huggingface and customise it to process any input sentence.\n",

The `roberta-base` model (a pre-trained RoBERTa model) is a general-purpose language model that can be fine-tuned on a variety of tasks, including sentiment analysis, but it may not perform as well as models that were specifically designed and trained for the sentiment analysis task."
